    "# Background\n",
    "The SIR [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) is an epidemiological model that is useful for understanding how infectious disease in humans and animals evolve over time. It is a compartmental model\n",
    "that divides the population into susceptible, infectious, and recovered groups. Given an initial population\n",
    "distribution, it models the evolution of the number of people in each compartment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\large Susceptible\\xrightarrow{\\beta}Infectious\\xrightarrow{\\gamma}Recovered\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is the transmission rate and $\\gamma$ is the recovery rate. Both are rates and therefore have units\n",
    "expressed in per unit time. Alternatively, $1/\\beta$ and $1/\\gamma$ are expressed in time units such as days, weeks,\n",
    "or months. For the purposes of the SIR model, the recovered group no longer affects disease transmission because\n",
    "they are either recovered, deceased, or immune."

    "# Why?\n",
    "When studying computational fluid dynamics in graduate school we sometimes found that our computed fluid flows failed\n",
    "to capture all of the features observed in the lab. In these cases, we always reminded ourselves that \"nature got the\n",
    "flow right.\" Models do not always capture every phenomena. The aphorism\n",
    "[\"All models are wrong, but some are useful\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) holds true for the\n",
    "SIR model. Populations are not constant. Transmission rates are not constant. That said, the model provides insights\n",
    "into the complex interactions that occur in real transmission. It shows the interaction between\n",
    "transmission rate and recovery rate and how they interact in ways that are not intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model is also important because it serves as the basis for other compartmental models. The simpler SI model can\n",
    "be derived as a special case when the recovery time is infinite. The SIS model\n",
    "can be used to model the common cold where recovery does not confer immunity. The SIRS model is an extension where\n",
    "immunity wanes over time like the flu. Armed with the information below these models will be within reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The SIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model starts with the assumption that the entire population can be divided into Susceptible, Infectious, and\n",
    "Recovered groups denoted by $S$, $I$, and $R$ respectively. The total population, denoted by $N$, is assumed to\n",
    "remain constant. These values are related as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N = {\\text{constant}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to model how the number of people in each group change over time. Taking the derivative with respect to\n",
    "time yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dI}{dt} +\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of change must net out to zero. If one bucket is draining another bucket must be filling up. The system of ordinary differential equations governing how the population in each bucket grow and shrinks is given by:\n",

    "It is important to remember that the variables $S$, $I$, and $R$ are always positive and may evolve with time while\n",
    "$N$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are all positive constants. Given an initial population for each compartment, we can evolve\n",
    "the populations in each bucket over time. Note that $S$ may never grow because $\\beta$, $I$, $S$, and $N$ are always\n",
    "positive which ensures that the rate is negative. Likewise, the population in the recovered compartment, $R$, may never decrease because both $\\gamma$ and $I$\n",
    "are positive ensuring that the growth rate is always postive. By contrast, the infectious population may grow or shrink depending on relative size of the two terms.\n",
