    "The SIR [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) is an epidemiological model that is useful for understanding how infectious disease in humans and animals evolve over time. It is a compartmental model\n",
    "that divides the population into susceptible, infectious, and recovered groups. Given an initial population\n",
    "distribution, it models the evolution of the number of people in each compartment over time.\n",

    "\\large Susceptible\\xrightarrow{\\beta}Infectious\\xrightarrow{\\gamma}Recovered\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "where $\\beta$ is the transmission rate and $\\gamma$ is the recovery rate. Both are rates and therefore have units\n",
    "expressed in per unit time. Alternatively, $1/\\beta$ and $1/\\gamma$ are expressed in time units such as days, weeks,\n",
    "or months. For the purposes of the SIR model, the recovered group no longer affects disease transmission because\n",

    "# Why?\n",
    "When studying computational fluid dynamics in graduate school we sometimes found that our computed fluid flows failed\n",

    "SIR model. Populations are not constant. Transmission rates are not constant. That said, the model provides insights\n",
    "into the complex interactions that occur in real transmission. It shows the interaction between\n",
    "transmission rate and recovery rate and how they interact in ways that are not intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model is also important because it serves as the basis for other compartmental models. The simpler SI model can\n",
    "be derived as a special case when the recovery time is infinite. The SIS model\n",
    "can be used to model the common cold where recovery does not confer immunity. The SIRS model is an extension where\n",

    "S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N = {\\text{constant}}\n",
